response
I only received the 3 and 6 months kits
I was only every sent 2 blood collections kits and so only completed the two
"Never received the last test. Was sent to wrong address then was to be corrected, however none came."
Did not receive the kits. Was misplaced in the mail.
I didn't  receive the first one
"I only received the first test, i kept waiting for the other tests to arrive but they never did."
"I did complete to the best of my ability, but it was tricky and as a younger person who can read and follow directions, the device was not ideal as I had no idea which way the blade would go and of course no idea how much blood I could produce for the test.   I would ask for extra lances next time."
"We found the process cumbersome and the blood difficult to draw, so it just kind of slipped off our radar and we did not finish the 6 month"
I asked for 2 tests - one for myself and one for my husband Stanley who was a quadriplegic - Locked in syndrome. I really wanted to protect him and have him tested. I tested myself first and had to prick my fingers twice and it took about 10 minutes to get enough blood on the strip and in the right place ( I have no medical or physical limitations). At that point I knew it would not be possible to get enough blood from Stan's finger and be able to hold it steady and in place to have him tested.
"The 1st and 2nd drops were ok, but getting the third was difficult."
Too many finger pricks and very time intensive process.
"I could not get enough blood to fill even one spot, despite warming and massaging my hand"
After reading the steps the process seemed overwhelming. Also I felt uncomfortable to use the tools provided to prick my finger. I am diabetic and in the past I've used a pen. I would only have press a button and the pen did the pricking.
"My second test was incomplete due to not being able to get enough blood, I suspect, or accidentally touching my finger to the paper as I tried to squeeze out enough blood. Highly frustrating. I think I made the poke incorrectly. I did not find the diagram helpful in determining what direction the poker would make the cut.(hopefully, you understand what I mean.)"
Hard to get enough blood
"My dad didn't even complete one test (94 years old), my husband did 2 with difficulty but didn't want to suffer through trying a third time. My first time was super easy as I had been doing housework, the second was OK, the third was a struggle!"
"I was unable to get enough blood to fill the 3 spots on the card, despite trying  twice and poking 2-3 fingers each time.  I called the phone# and they told me I can just give up the test."
"Not enough blood to put on circle target, or/and to much blood dropped at time and circle target was over lines, ended up being blotchy and not enough to complete all circle targets"
"I did complete them all, though one of them I didn't get all the spots completed (couldn't squeeze enough blood out). I was overall very squeemish about pricking my finger."
"I cant remember if I completed all three blood spots for each test, but I found it difficult to get enough blood to fill the circles."
I always got enough blood on the card it was just a challenge. I always had to prick 2 fingers and would just get enough blood.
It was very difficult to provide the amount of blood samples required. Also had a house flood and subsequent months of restoration which took over all of my time.
"I was happy to help the BCCDC and be part of the survey - the finger prick was difficult to get enough blood for the test and it was a bit more of a complicated procedure than I thought but I was willing to continue. But then after the first test, I was alerted that my private information had been leaked as part of this survey. That really put me off being part of this."
"I did not complete the final test, once you revealed that the results from the first test had been misaddressed. From that point, I did not trust that my information would be kept secure."
I dont think I received the 6 month test
I dont remember if i did 3
"I put the kit up and away when I was doing a chore, and simply forgot about it... so sorry."
"To be honest, I can't remember doing the 3rd test. I don't recall getting it in the mail."
It wasn't top of mind and then when i'd see the package again a few weeks later I thought it was too late to send it in (that the study ran along a specific timeline).
I couldn't complete the 6 month as i moved and misplaced the kit for the final reporting.
"I missed the last set of tests because I was out of the region and by the time I returned home, the package had been misplaced. I found it months later."
I actually kept forgetting to do it
I completely forgot about it.  More persistent email reminders would have helped me
I sent in the last one too late. I really wanted to know the answerer: human error.
"I did complete all blood spots, but it wasn't easy and I had to order an additional test which I did manage to complete. Sometimes I couldn't get enough blood out of my finger!"
i MAY HAVE ONLY COMPLETED BASELINE & 3 MONTHS
was able to complete the full set
We completed all tests.   Blood collection particularly challenging for the child participants
"I completed the full test but didn  t complete on time. It seemed like a difficult job and thus i kept delaying the test. Once i read the instructions it was pretty easy to follow and mail the test box. I am sorry for not following the test date. I will do better in future, now that I know how easy it was."
It was okay once I got used to it.
"I did manage to get a complete set for all three (I believe), BUT the devices were faulty, the plunger didn't work as expectced and it was very difficult to get a good clean ""hit"" to draw sufficient blood for the third test."
I did all of the tests but I don  t love blood so I feel dizzy after doing each test.
"I did complete the full set of Dry Blood Spot tests, but for the first one in particular, it was difficult to get enough blood to put on the card as requested."
Sent in second test but it seems to have been misplaced
Time away from me because of events happening in my family life.
I got sick with Covid-19 within a few days after submitting the 6-month survey and that disrupted my survey response. I did not see the value of following up after I recovered. I also got caught up to dealing with the day to day and put it out of my mind.
"Got caught up with daily life and didn't get around to it. Also, I thought that I had to do it as well as my kids or not bother at all."
"Life got crazy, was unable to play. Sorry about that."
"Was trying to find a time to do when all 3 family members present , challenging with 3 generations and daughter at university"
"i can't remember if i did complete them all. If i didn't it was just because family life during summer and then school year / hockey is busy and didn't get around to it. I guess you could say it took some focus to figure out the survey for each person and the mailing box for each person, etc. Also i felt the survey time intensive to answer and really didn't like the free form activity listing."
Hard to get the 3 family members together as daughter away at university. So gave up on the 3rd sample
"Work got crazy and the house burst 3 pipes in the cold, so I did not complete the tests. Sorry."
honestly was so busy with a new job & family that I kept forgetting to do the 3rd test
"We were travelling a lot and when the kits arrived, it was just not a good time."
"I registered for my myself, my sister, and my dad. I would've completed it but I was in and out of town over the past year so unfortunately was not able to. My sister was averse to it after the first and second time, not comprehending the value of her contribution at the expense of a little bleeding. While there were reminder emails sent to her, I believe personal phone calls to connect with her would have been beneficial. Further, tangible benefits may have been good too (i.e. vouchers/gift cards). While knowing the findings of our antigens was nice, the delay in getting the result versus the immediacy of pricking a finger didn't really balance out. I personally tried my best to remind and encourage them to complete the series. Thank you to BCCDC for this initiative."
Busy schedule and kept forgetting for the third one
I think I forgot to do the 6 month. We  run a very busy business and I had many other priorities. I do apologize.
Third time I was out of country
"I missed the 6-month one due to busyness. And then I got COVID after that, so I just forgot about the test for a while."
I missed the second one because I have so much on my plate that the package took the back burner and got forgotten.
It was time consuming and difficult to get our kids to do the test multiple times
"The third test fell during a really hectic time (work was extremely stressful and my husband was sick), and completely the test simply slipped through the cracks in the chaos"
I have three kids as a single dad. It was just too much work for me to get any samples done.
"Just not getting around to it, kind of unpleasant & time-consuming, and I was travelling for the final month."
"Too busy, lost interest"
Was not in the country
"ADHD brain - in addition, honestly, my brain works with now/not now and between balancing work, children, family, life etc...yeah things will get left behind. I know how important these tests are, so sometimes tasks like this overlap with other things that are important in my life."
"Was difficult to collect the first sample, had to do more than one finger, fingers were sore for multiple days after so when it was time to complete the next blood spot test would procrastinate and delay doing the test to avoid inconvenience of dealing with sore fingers and cuts on fingers."
"Pricking my finger hurt a lot. It hurt when I pricked it, and my finger continued to hurt for a day after I pricked it. For this reason, I only completed the baseline test."
Did not like the blood sampling process
"I think I did but my husband did not. My response was very late for the 6 month one I think. I put it off when I got it in the mail and unfortunately shuffled the little box under something and forgot about it. So procrastination for me.  (for my husband, a fear of needles so the entire things was harder for him and he didn't do the 6 month one)."
"Had intended on completing the tests but did not due to time, not wanting to prick finger, no one else in the house hold seemed interested in completing the tests."
The first test actually was quite painful! It took a couple of days for the cut to heal. I didn  t want to do it again.
I chickened out.
"I missed the 3-month blood test. I was suffering from a flair-up of an autoimmune condition I have and everything hurt on me. Pricking my finger, although a small task, was something I couldn't do."
We did complete but not in 3 month intervals as we did delay out of reluctance to prick our fingers again and again as getting enough blood to fill the dots was painful.
It took too long for the finger prick to heal to do it again
Was difficult to get enough blood for the tests and it hurt
Children said no after first experience - too painful as had to prick finger multiple times due to difficulty filling spots
"The prick was actually a slice of the finger tip which then took many painful days to heal for me, it was a major deterrent. I'd rather have a blood draw."
it was uncomfortable
It hurt and I didn't want to do it again
"I can't recall if I did complete the full set or if I only managed the first two. It was incredibly difficult to get enough blood to put on the card, and I ended up feeling quite woozy and anxious from trying to."
Painful finger slice to get lots of blood
Obtaining the blood sample was too painful.
I take a blood thinner and was worried about doing the test-also sometimes faint at the site of blood.
I didn't feel comfortable pricking my finger to collect the blood and was unable to complete the tests.
"My samples were late, since I was scared to cause myself pain and had to work up to it."
I did it but the rest of my family didn  t complete the test because the prick was so painful for days afterwards.
"Was not clear when I should be doing the various tests, and the kits was easy to misplace."
"I felt misled. The invitation to participate in the study said I would learn if I had had COVID. The report said I might have had it or I might have been vaccinated. Perhaps I misread instructions, but this was my expectation."
don't remember being informed we would have to complete 3x once was enough. poor communication
I procrastinated during the 3-month timeframe.
"I didn't complete the final one, because I did the survey online saying I had not recently had Covid, but then I came down with Covid before I could complete the blood test. So I didn't complete the final blood test, as it would not have been accurate with what I reported on the survey"
The last one we just procrastinated too long and missed the cutoff date. I didn't love pricking my finger but it wasn't that hard. Just kind of lost momentum after the second test.
Because I had already completed my online baseline survey for the 6 month one and then I ended up getting a flu shot and COVID booster after completing it but did mail and do the sample yet
"I did it twice, didn  t want to do it a third time."
Came down with Covid
