## Notes

> Race is a social construct that has historically been used to classify human beings according to physical or biological characteristics. Ethnicity is something a person acquires or ascribes to and refers to a shared culture, such as language, practices, and beliefs.

   <summary>Onomap </summary>

   >  been developed by the Department of
Geography at University College London.27 Version 2,
developed in 2009, comprises 448,657 surnames and 253,881
forenames derived from public name registries from over 26
countries. Each of these names has been classified into
a cultural ethnic or linguistic group using name network
clustering techniques.27 Each name in the Onomap
dictionary has been assigned an Onomap type (the lowest
level in the classification), together with a probability score
that summarizes the likelihood of a particular name
belonging to such a type. Such probability score is derived
from the share of the population with that (fore/sur)name
that also has a (sur/fore)name belonging to the same
Onomap type. When classifying a list of names, the
Onomap software assesses both components of a person’s
name (forename and surname) to come up with a final
ethnicity classification at the individual level. In cases of
conflict between a person’s forename and surname, it
assigns the Onomap type with the highest probability score.
The Onomap classification represents the most likely
origins of a person’s name according to one or several of the
following dimensions of identity: religious tradition,
geographic origin, ethnic background and language (or
common linguistic heritage).
