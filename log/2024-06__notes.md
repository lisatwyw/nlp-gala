- Audience: 3 (?) regional health authorities 

## A. Users' requirements

- Target users: not for general public
  - Themes: domain-expert
- Timeliness
- Representativeness
- Grant application opportunity: OCAP principles
  
## B. Target Product

### Component 1 - Prototyping core functionalities [ETA: 2 co-op terms]

- Vision: PESTEL framework
  - 5-6 tabs: social, legal, etc.
- Possible functions to be implemented in phase 1
  - Function A - Minutes/ bylaws/ agenda
  - Function B - Transcription of videos
  - Function C - Social media, Twitter, local news
  - Function D - Grey literature summarizations

### Component 2 - Webscraping  [ETA: 1 co-op term to start; sporadic short-term hourly tasks for maintenance]
  - Building toolkits: Selenium vs regular
  - Storage mechanics:
    - For backend analyses: dropbox and assessible via O drive?
    - For server: Google drive for users' access as already done    
  - Automation pipeline
  - Maintenance: website changes would require new configurations

### Component 3 - Web app / visualization of analyses  [ETA: 2 co-op terms]
  - Consideratoins: Tableau, Python ```Streamlit```
  - Features:
    - Interactive
    - Frequency counts
    - Widgets for keyword search(es)
    
  
## C. Implementation plan  

- Phase 1: minimalistic
- Phase 2:
  - Integration of XAI + LLM 
- Phase 3:
  - Modularization for cross-centre collaboration/ sustainable maintenance 
- Phase X: equity/ disparities
  - Integrate aggregrated data from PAWS
  - e.g. census   


## D. Implications

- Monitor: time window
- Effectiveness of bylaws/ policies (difficult to prove)
